I am an angel investor and an accomplished business leader experienced with building, managing, and contributing 
to software development, business development/sales, and technical program management teams.  I am looking for 
top impact positions and business opportunities.  Top impact means you and I are doing something 
that matters, and that our decisions actively make or break a successful endeavour.  I provide top value by 
actively driving product definition, business strategy, and revenue generation as either an individual contributor or manager. 
Colleagues and friends alike regard me as a collaborative team leader who is easy to work with and is not afraid to tackle new 
challenges head on and find innovative solutions. You can get a more comprehensive picture of my skills by
