I am an angel investor and an accomplished business leader with directorial proficiency in 
software development, business development, and technical program management.  I am looking for 
top impact positions and business opportunities.  Top impact means you and I are doing something 
that matters, and that our decisions actively make or break a successful endeavour.  I provide top impact by 
actively driving product definition, business strategy, and revenue generation. Both colleagues and 
friends alike regard me as a collaborative team leader who is easy to work with and is not afraid to tackle new 
challenges head on and find innovative solutions. You can get a more comprehensive picture of my skills by
